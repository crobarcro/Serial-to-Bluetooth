- Connect a RS485 serial interface to a Bluetooth device (like a smartphone);
- Fully programmable function thanks to an ATMEGA microcontroller, easily accessible through 6-pin header;
- Industrial-grade components with lot of redundancy;
- Originally developed as the hardware companion for my [BTDisplay - controlling a Siemens wind turbine with my smartphone](https://github.com/holodon/BTDisplayOSS);
- General purpose LED;
- Rechargeable battery with a simple but effective charging circuit;
- Really small form factor - pictures available in the [media section](media).
